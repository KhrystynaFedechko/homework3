            <h2>Party Planning Made Easy</h2>
            <p>Horrified at the idea of throwing a Halloween bash? Don’t be afraid—we’ve made a list of everything you’ll need for a frightfully fabulous event.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Food and Drink</h3>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li><b><i>Candy and loot bags</i></b>
                    <br>Set out glass jars loaded with different types of candies and mini scoops, and let guests fill their own goodie bags to take home.
                    <br>Go to candywarehouse.com to stock up on a variety of treats, from gross gummy body parts (feet, ears, and eyeballs) to classics 
                    <br>like Pixy Stix and Bazooka.
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Punch bowl</i></b>
                    <br>No Halloween party would be complete without a spooky punch. Serve one that’s blood-red, ghoulish green, putrid purple, orange,
                    <br>or black and use dry ice to create an eerie mist.
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Napkins, plates, utensils, and tablecloths</i></b>
                    <br>Keep a stash of these essentials in colors and patterns that match your scheme. A festive covering will make your everyday tables
                    <br>party-ready in an instant. PartyCity.com has a wide selection of Halloween-themed goods, along with supplies in basic colors.
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Serving dishes</i></b>
                    <br>Count your platters beforehand to make sure you have enough space for all your party treats. Make a list or label each dish 
                    <br>with a Post-it note or masking tape to keep track of which food goes with which platter.
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Beverages and cups</i></b>
                    <br>If you’re serving alcoholic drinks, plan on three to four cocktails per guest for a two- to three-hour party. And don’t forget 
                    <br>to include something alcohol-free and fun for the teetotalers and kids in your group. Make sure to have heatproof cups on hand if you’re
                    <br>serving anything hot, like mulled cider.
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Appetizers</i></b>
                    <br>Serve plenty of savory items to balance out all that Halloween sugar. For less stress, make as many items ahead of time as you can.
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Desserts</i></b>
                    <br>Cupcakes and cookies are easy for guests to eat and fun to decorate for Halloween (for example: cookies shaped like ghosts and cats and 
                    <br>cupcakes topped with orange frosting or mini pumpkin candies). For even more holiday spirit, make pumpkin cupcakes and decorate them with 
                    <br>candy corn. Or try using Halloween candy in creative ways: Serve a Twix cheesecake pie or make chocolate bark decorated with candy corn.

                <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><b><i>Carved jack-o’-lanterns</i></b>
                    <br>Greet guests with a lineup of these lighted hosts on your stoop or porch.  
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Pumpkins and decorative gourds</i></b>
                    <br>Display these in clusters around your home. Try different ways of dressing up your pumpkins—spray them with metallic paint for a golden 
                    <br>glow or use chalkboard paint to make faces or write messages (a great project for the kids).  
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Fake cobwebs and spiders, paper bats, balloons, and other decorations</i></b>
                    <br>Hang cobwebs and spiders in the corners of your room, let bats and banners dangle from the ceiling, and go all-out with festive or frightening
                    <br>décor to create the right atmosphere. Shop for supplies from OrientalTrading.com, which has a wide selection of creepy goods—bags of bones, 
                    <br>ghosts, and tombstones. Halloween is one holiday when it’s OK to be over-the-top.  
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Candles</i></b>
                    <br>Scatter lots of votives throughout your party and group pillars of varying heights and sizes together. Display a candelabra for dramatic flair.  
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Spooky music</i></b>
                    <br>Put together a playful playlist of favorite songs, such as The Doors’ “People Are Strange” and Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” or invest in
                    <br>a soundtrack of creepy sound effects. Try Martha Stewart Living’s Spooky Scary Sounds (which includes knives being sharpened, thumping heartbeats,
                    <br>and howling winds) or Halloween Horrorscapes, which features tracks titled “Blood Hunt” and “Alone at the Cabin” (including thunder, screams, 
                    <br>snarling monsters, and chainsaws–definitely not for the faint of heart).  
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Halloween movies</i></b>
                    <br>Play classic horror films in the background (on mute if you don’t want the sound to be distracting) to get guests in the mood, such as Friday 
                    <br>the 13th, The Exorcist, or, naturally, Halloween. For less frightening movies that still set the tone, try The Addams Family, Beetlejuice, 
                    <br>or—the best feel-good Halloween flick ever—It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.  
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Costume accessories</i></b>
                    <br>Whether you’re hosting a costume party or not, it’s always fun to have some extra dress-up items around. Set out some masks and wigs, plastic fangs,
                    <br>hats, a cape, a tiara, a feather boa—whatever suits your fancy—and let your guests get creative.  
                    </li>
                    <li><b><i>Camera</i></b>
                    <br>Don’t forget to recharge your batteries and clear space on your memory card before your Halloween bash. Designate a friend or family member as the 
                    <br>party photographer so you’ll have one less thing to worry about.  
                    </li>
